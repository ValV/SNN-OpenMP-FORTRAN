## Simple Neural Network program in FORTAN
---

This piece of code demonstrates, perhaps, the simplest NN using backpropagation. The idea is based on [Trask's Neural Network in 11 lines](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network). 

### TODO
- [x] Step 1: adopt Python code
- [ ] Step 2: optimize for Fortran and try to parallelize the task
- [ ] Step 3: add OpenMP directives for parallel execution
- [ ] Step 4: provide performance tests
